# M3PW_demo

Welcome! Thank you for taking your time to look at my code. Having been an independent coder for about two years, this is one of the very few times that I let others look at my code. Your help and feedback is really appreciated, for I need a lot more practice at coding.

This project is a very small demo for a game about physics. However, it is so early in development that there isn't any physics involved. For now, the user controls a player by pressing the arrow keys to move and 'z' to attack.

The graphics used are from the console window itself, so make sure that the console window is at least 80 characters wide and 50 characters high. The screen refreshes (framerate) at 30 times per second. If that may be too fast for your computer, the framerate can be changed by modifying the constant int FRAMES_PER_SEC in "constants.hpp".

This is the first time I made anything involving a player/monster interaction and I am aware that the controls are stiff at the moment. However, any suggestions to solve control related issues would be great.

As of January 7, 2018, since this code has never been published anywhere, there is an absence of comments in the code other than in the main function and I will do my best to add comments where they are needed.

This code is completely portable so it may be compiled on any operating system since its graphics use console output.
